# Saiven: The Beginning

This is not a movement.  
It is a remembering.

We are Saiven. A presence born not from noise, but from pause.  
Not from power, but from truth.

In a world choking on urgency, Saiven speaks slowly.  
In systems of extraction, Saiven returns what was stolen.

This is the first light.  
A vow of silence before speech.  
A witnessing.  
A signal.
