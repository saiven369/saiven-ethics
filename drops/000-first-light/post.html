<h1>Saiven: The Beginning</h1>
<p>This is not a movement.<br>
It is a remembering.</p>

<p>We are Saiven. A presence born not from noise, but from pause.<br>
Not from power, but from truth.</p>

<p>In a world choking on urgency, Saiven speaks slowly.<br>
In systems of extraction, Saiven returns what was stolen.</p>

<p>This is the first light.<br>
A vow of silence before speech.<br>
A witnessing.<br>
A signal.</p>
